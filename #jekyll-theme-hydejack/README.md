**Hydejack** is a boutique Jekyll theme for hackers, nerds, and academics, with a focus on personal sites that are meant to impress. 

It includes a blog that is suitable for both prose and technical documentation, a portfolio to showcase your projects, and a resume template that looks amazing on the web and in print.

> Your complete presence on the web — A [blog], [portfolio], and [resume].



## A Personal Site That Won't Disappear

**Hydejack** is 100% built on Open Source software, and is Open Source itself, save for parts of the PRO version. The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.

Hydejack is all static sites. _HTML_. All you need is a web server — any web server — to have a professional web presence that lasts a lifetime.


## A Free Blogging Theme
**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.

## An Impressive Portfolio
A portfolio that's guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it.

## Just Markdown
Write all content with Markdown. __Hydejack__ gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.


## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```html
<!-- file: `_includes/my-body.html` -->
<script type="module">
  document.querySelector("hy-push-state").addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
    const supportsCodeHighlights = false; // TBD!!
  });
</script>
```

<p align="center">Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.



## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

<p align="center">Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.
