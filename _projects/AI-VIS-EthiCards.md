We present AI-VIS EthiCards, a card-based approach to explore ethics tailored for AI for visualization. The continuous integration of artificial intelligence and data visualization has brought about increased efficiency and benefits, yet inevitably raises ethical concerns. The emerging field of AI for visualization is marked by its inherent complexity, making it crucial for researchers, designers, and practitioners to cultivate ethical literacy and contemplate moral obligations within this intricate environment. These cards aim to aid users in learning, discussing, and reflecting on the ethical dilemmas that may arise from the integration of AI technology and visualization. 

The AI-VIS EthiCard set contains six themes: Goals, AI-VIS Tasks, Technologies, Ethical Principles, People-In-Focus, and Challenges, proposes various modes of use, including theoretical exploration, and design development simulations, with five activities. We aim to offer users an exploratory and open approach to discussions, providing multiple perspectives to guide ethical considerations when applying AI for visualization.
