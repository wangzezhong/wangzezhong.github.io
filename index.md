I'm Zezhong Wang (王 泽中), currently a Ph.D. student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I work in the [Visual+Interactive Data Lab (VisHub)](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/bach.html) with an interdisciplinary team, supervised by [Dr. Benjamin Bach](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/bach.html) and [Dr. Dave Murray-Rust](http://dave.murray-rust.org/). My Ph.D. investigates [Data Comics](https://datacomics.github.io/) for data-driven storytelling, exploring its features, creation methodology and applications.
