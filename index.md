<!-- My work integrates design practices with technological innovations to enhance how people engage with and understand data. With a background in user-experience design and data visualization, I have dedicated my research to improving the experience of human-data interaction, empowering non-experts to interpret data.  -->



We live in a world overflowing with data, the ability to understand and utilize data has become more critical than ever. Yet, for many people—non-experts and the general public—data feels cold, distant, or even exclusionary, like a language they were never taught to speak. This disconnect has real consequences: it fuels inequity, spreads misinformation, and leaves communities feeling powerless to address challenges like climate change or public health crises. In this landscape, the need for clear, engaging, and compelling data communication is urgent.

My work is rooted in a simple belief: *data should be human*. It should spark curiosity, invite interaction, and tell stories that resonate with people’s lives. By blending data visualization, narrative storytelling, and human-centered technology, I strive to turn data into a tool for connection, empowerment, and joy--transforming abstract numbers into meaningful experiences that inspire action.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [ixLab](https://ixlab.cs.sfu.ca/), [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) working alongside [Dr. Sheelagh Carpendale](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~sheelagh/). Previously, I earned my PhD in 2022 from  the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Benjamin Bach](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/bach.html) and [Dr. Dave Murray-Rust](http://dave.murray-rust.org/). 

<!-- My PhD investigates [Data Comics](https://datacomics.github.io/), PhD thesis entitled [Creating Data Comics for Data-Driven Storytelling](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/38793?show=full). -->
